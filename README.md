# Calling for better environmental clearance data in India

With the stated intention of standardizing and rendering transparent the grant of environmental clearances, in March 2020, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MOEF&CC) of the Government of India, published a draft proposal of amendments to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, titled [Draft EIA 2020](1. Draft EIA notification - http://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/Draft_EIA_2020.pdf). Since the EIA process is crucial to balance environmental imperatives with economic development, environmentalists nationwide have voiced concerns with respect to the Draft EIA 2020 citing considerable [dilution of existing EIA regulations](https://science.thewire.in/environment/eia-2020-environmental-degradation-draft/). 

The EIA rules were initially promulgated in 1994 (citation), and amended by ministerial notification in 2006 (citation). Using MOEF&CC Forest Clearance data (citation), 1994 â€“ present as an example, we find that projects applied for significantly more forest area to be cleared when or shortly after new EIA rules were adopted, with an average 3,587 sq.km. proposed for clearance in 1995 and 2006, nearly four times as much as in other years (mean: 723 sq.km., quasipoisson Generalised Linear Model _t_ = 8.534, _p_ < 0.001). Further, applications in these years were disproportionately more successful than in other years (Y% more successful). Lack of easy access to basic information such as the time between project application and decision prevents us from disentangling potential factors underlying observed jumps in forest clearance applications.

Fearing inexplicable forest clearances commensurate with 1995 and 2006 on the adoption of Draft EIA 2020, we urge scientists and concerned parties in India to demand that MOEF&CC data be more easily accessible for independent analysis, and remind scientists worldwide that public scrutiny is essential for transparent governance.
