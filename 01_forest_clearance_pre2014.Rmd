# Forest clearance applications pre-2014

There are three types of clearance data on the PARIVESH portal, hosted by the MOEF&CC. These include: Environmental, Forests and Wildlife. The data for Forests and Wildlife are quantifiable, although the data for Wildlife was not available as an excel file and this information need to be obtained from the website. 

All analysis being performed is through the R programming environment. Please feel free to edit and use this code as you please. The data used for this purpose is available through the 'Data' folder. 

## Load data

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(sf)
library(rlang)
library(lubridate)
library(scico)
library(ggrepel)
```

First, we will carry out some exploratory data analysis using the Forest clearance data. The data available has been stored in 5 separate excel files:

1. All data prior to 2014
2. Data after 2014 is subdivided into:
    a) Allocation of fresh forest land (Form-A)	
    b) Application Under Section 2(iii)	
    c) Renewal of lease (Form-B)	
    d) Prospecting of Minerals (Form-C)

```{r}

## 1. Let's read in the data prior to 2014
pre_2014 <- read_csv("Data/forest_clearance/for_clear_before_2014.csv")

# rename columns
pre_2014 <- pre_2014 %>% 
  `colnames<-`(str_replace_all(str_to_lower(colnames(.)),
                               " ", "_"))

# get year of applications
pre_2014 <- mutate(pre_2014,
                   year = year(dmy(date_from_ua_to_nodal))) %>% 
  filter(year >= 2000) %>% 
  mutate(period = if_else(year < 2006, "2000 - 2006", "2006 - 2014"))
```

## Basic analyses

### What is the status of applications?

```{r}
# what is the most common status
count(pre_2014, proposal_status) %>% arrange(-n)

# what are the most common categories weighted by area
count(pre_2014, category, wt = area_applied) %>% 
  arrange(-n)

# what are the top categories
top_categories <- count(pre_2014, category, wt = area_applied) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  .$category %>% head(5)
# what is the area applied for in general
pre_2014 %>% 
  # filter(status != "unsuccessful") %>% 
count(category, status,
      period,
      wt = area_applied) %>% 
  filter(category %in% top_categories) %>% 
  
  group_by(category) %>% 
  mutate(total_area = sum(n)) %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(category, total_area), 
               y = n,
               fill = status,
               group = category),
           position = "stack")+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2),
                   label = str_to_title)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = "batlow") +
  facet_grid(~period) +
  labs(x = "Project Category",
       y = "Forest area cleared (hectares)")

ggsave("Figures/fig_area_by_category.png")

# get broader categories
pre_2014 <- pre_2014 %>% 
  mutate(status = case_when(
    str_detect(proposal_status, "PENDING|RETURNED|SECRETARY|COMPLIANCE") ~
      "pending",
    str_detect(proposal_status, "APPROVED|IN-PRINCIPLE") ~
      "successful",
    str_detect(proposal_status, "REJECTED|REVOKED|WITHDRAWN|CLOSED") ~
      "unsuccessful",
    T ~ "other"
  ))

# reorder factors
pre_2014 <- pre_2014 %>% 
  mutate(status = forcats::fct_relevel(status,
                                       "successful",
                                       "unsuccessful",
                                       "pending",
                                       "other"))
```

A couple of analyses and plots for the forest clearance data:  

The total number of forest clearances prior to 2014 that were approved and/or in other categories including pending etc was 31,883  

The total number of forest clearances prior to 2014 that were rejected / withdrawn / closed was 5,768  

Let's summarize the area of forests cleared vs. those not cleared (Rejected proposals)  

21,63,215 hectares of forests were approved to be cleared prior to 2014/pending   
8,48,475 hectares of forests were not cleared or proposals were rejected/withdrawn  

In other words, over 84.68% of proposals submitted were approved or pending to be approved! 

```{r}

# Area saved / rejected proposals
n_reject <- pre_2014 %>% select(PROPOSAL_STATUS,AREA_APPLIED) %>%
  group_by(PROPOSAL_STATUS, AREA_APPLIED) %>%
  filter(PROPOSAL_STATUS=="REJECTED" | PROPOSAL_STATUS=="CLOSED" |
         PROPOSAL_STATUS=="RETURNED" | PROPOSAL_STATUS=="REVOKED" |
           PROPOSAL_STATUS=="WITHDRAWN") %>% summarise() %>% tally(AREA_APPLIED)%>%
  tally(n)

n_reject # 8,48,475 hectares of forests were not cleared prior to 2014

# Area cleared / approved proposals and/or pending
n_appro <- pre_2014 %>% select(PROPOSAL_STATUS,AREA_APPLIED) %>%
  group_by(PROPOSAL_STATUS, AREA_APPLIED) %>% summarise() %>%   tally(AREA_APPLIED) %>% tally(n) - n_reject

n_appro # 21,63,215 hectares of forests were cleared or approved to be cleared / pending

```

Let's calculate the area of forests approved or pending to be approved as function of the category they were binned under:

Encroachments and mining contributed most to the loss of forest area prior to 2014.

```{r}

# Here onwards we will use only the proposals that were approved or pending to be approved
appro_pre_2014 <- pre_2014 %>%
  filter(!(PROPOSAL_STATUS=="REJECTED" | PROPOSAL_STATUS=="CLOSED" |
         PROPOSAL_STATUS=="RETURNED" | PROPOSAL_STATUS=="REVOKED" |
           PROPOSAL_STATUS=="WITHDRAWN")) %>%
  filter(!DATE=="1882")

# Data by category and area
cat_area <- appro_pre_2014 %>% 
  group_by(CATEGORY) %>%
  summarise(Total_area = sum(AREA_APPLIED)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(CATEGORY = stringr::str_to_title(CATEGORY))

# Create a plot
cat_plot <-
ggplot(cat_area %>% 
         filter(Total_area > 10), 
       aes(x = CATEGORY , y = Total_area, 
           fill= CATEGORY)) +   
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           color = "black", 
           size = 0.08,
           position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::comma(round(Total_area))), 
            position = position_dodge(width=1),
            size = 3, vjust = -0.5)+ 
  theme_minimal(base_family = "TT Arial") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "sqrt",
                     labels = scales::comma,
                     breaks = c(0.25, 0.5, 1:6) * 1e5) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 4)) +
  labs(x = "Category", 
       y = "Total Area (in hectares)") +
  theme(#axis.text.x = element_text(angle=, hjust=1),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid.minor =  element_blank()) +
  scico::scale_fill_scico_d(palette = "roma")

ggsave(cat_plot, filename = "Figures/cat_area_pre2014.png",
       width= 12, height= 7, dpi = 300)

Lets calculate the area of forests approved or pending to be approved as function of the state.

Lets calculate the area of forests approved or pending to be approved as function of the state and the category. 

Madhya Pradesh lost a vast chunk of it's forests prior to 2014, followed by Arunachal Pradesh - two states that possess an astounding level of biodiversity

```{r}
